Moge tee & Korean Style Chicken,4.3,"848 Spring St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA",(404) 963-7986,"Great place, clean, open till late, delicious drink menus. Go for 30% sugar if you don't like sweet. 50% was still a bit sweet for me.","I had drumsticks today, but the smell was soooooo bad... 🤢I’ve never had such a strong, unpleasant chicken odor before. This really needs to be addressed. But tender is good.","We had a fantastic experience here! The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. It was our first time there, and the person taking our order was very patient. The atmosphere is also very relaxing.

One thing we really liked was the the flexibility in how you order—you can place your order at the counter or use a kiosk if you want to take your time (great for those days when you just need a little space).

The matcha tea… Absolutely amazing—easily the best we’ve had in Atlanta! We’ll definitely be back."
Park 27 Korean BBQ and Bar - Midtown,4.3,"950 W Peachtree St NW Suite 255, Atlanta, GA 30309, USA",(770) 727-7275,"Solo dining at a Korean BBQ place is a great change of pace from being in a group. I am here in Atlanta for work. I didn’t want the fact that I was a party of 1 to stop me from getting my meat on. And it did not. I dove in with the marinated short rib and it was spot on. Just as good as many of the other great kbbq places I’ve been. I also went with the thin sliced pork belly which was crispy and delicious and perfect for dipping in all the sauces. Best of all, I didn’t have to grill any of it myself! No extra effort and no taking the smoky aromas home! Or in my case hotel. Just beautifully cooked short rib and pork belly served up by staff who were friendly and helpful despite being very busy. When you’re ready to order, don’t forget to hit the call button next to the table. I enjoyed my solo experience and who knows? Maybe I’ll bring some folks along next time…maybe.",Great restaurant with a magnificent decor and great food. The service at the bar was really slow.  Next time will pick a table. Lots of flavor and very unique  menu. The price is extremely competitive for the area. Overall was a good experience. Will def comeback with friends. Highly recommend we,"Absolutely fantastic experience! The food was incredible—fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked right at the table. But what truly set this place apart was the outstanding service. The staff was not only friendly and attentive but also incredibly knowledgeable, making the meal even more enjoyable. Ask to be helped by Jofran! He is the man!

The atmosphere is vibrant and full of energy, making it a perfect spot for a fun night out.

If you have never had Korean BBQ get your butt in here and try!"
CM Korean Fried Chicken & Ssong’s Hot Dog,4.2,"525 10th St NW, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",(404) 881-8856,"Real good!
Pricey and for me was great.
I wish the tenders could be a little bigger but still a great place to eat.
All cooked to perfection.
Very modern way to order at the big screens.
Was fast.
We ordered chicken, and I should try different flavors.
Absolutely, I recommend this place!
Also, I ordered Bobba
Yummy!🥰🥰🥰🥰",All the food we ordered was delicious. We were traveling and stopped because they had great reviews. We will definitely come back anytime we drive through. The staff was all lap helpful and nice.,"Stopped here because Rocky Mountain Pizza’s kitchen canceled my door dash, and after I took a Lyft thier kitchen had JuST closed. I am not disappointed as their automated ordering and fast service ended up producing delicious and hot food. Some of the locals mentioned it’s open until 2am for all your early morning munch needs!"
Pelicana Chicken Atlanta,4.9,"420 14th St NW #100A, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",(404) 856-3960,"So we just stumbled upon this restaurant as we were walking past it. Saw the great reviews so decided to try it. There is a big halal sign outside and very also verified with the owner that their chicken is halal. That was the main reason for us to eat here.

Service is great and welcoming. Served small cups of Korean coffee on the house.

We ordered the full chicken, spicy and crispy with side of garlic sauce.

It was good but my observations were 1) full chicken is cut up into 14 small pieces but some pieces just have a lot of crispy batter but no real meat, just bones. Even the pieces that have meat, have a lot of extra batter but not much meat 2) the 3 sides are very small for a full chicken platter

Overall, it was good but not great. Didn't feel like we got a full chicken.","Food and staff were excellent. Best wings and french fries I have ever had. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Wanted to give them 5 stars, but we had 2 young children, and the music at first was VERY explicit and inappropriate. Once they noticed they changed the music. Parking was also limited, and had broken glass like someone's window had been busted, so was a little worried parking my car behind the restaurant. Like I said best wings I've ever had, and the fries were amazing too! If we ever visit Atlanta again we will absolutely be going back.",Been riding past this place for a long time. Finally decided to stop in on a Saturday night. Wasn’t crowded at all. Not much parking in the front but there is a parking lot right in the back with plenty of free parking. The Atmosphere was amazing the lighting the cleanliness and just overall customer service was top tier! Let’s not forget about the food because that was the icing on the cake! Food was hot and fresh tasted amazing. I’ll definitely be back☺️
Mukja Korean Fried Chicken,4.5,"933 Peachtree St NE Suite 951, Atlanta, GA 30309, USA",(404) 855-5516,"Mukja Korean Fried Chicken delivers a crispy, flavorful punch that’s hard to beat. Their signature wings are perfectly fried golden, crunchy on the outside, and juicy on the inside! 2nd time visiting here and they still deliver consistent food and service as well!","I thought i left a review. Anyway, I came during AWA and this was my first time. I had a gift for the owner but he didn't work that day maybe next time😅. Food wise everything was great definitely has a bit of spice but it was flavorful and you could see and taste the love they put into this. Also, there was a parking deck right next to the store with varying times. My order took about 10-20 mins(large order) and i didn't even have to pay. 100% check this place out",Kevin the gentleman behind the counter was so cool. Explaining everything on the menu to us. It was our first time. Food was A1! Customer service A1! Never had kim chi on Mac & Cheese before. Chicken was juicy and seasoned well!
Park27 Korean BBQ and Bar - Centennial Park,4.7,"275 Baker St NW Suite B, Atlanta, GA 30313, USA",(404) 390-3009,"If you are looking for a different dining experience, this is the place for you. You get to socialize and cook the food and then enjoy the great food. The staff here go above and beyond, will give recommendations and assist you with grilling the meats. Very accommodating. We did the all you can eat dinner option and was not disappointed. Ate more than we probably should have and everything was amazing. Definitely worth the price. Meal comes with lots of banchan (side dishes located around the grill) and four difference sauces to dip your meats into. Highly recommend.","We got the AYCE Lunch menu (eat all you can) and it was very good! I like how the meat was fresh. The meat was cooked at the table and it was a great experience. There were also a lot of side dishes that complemented the meats they offered, fresh and yummy! Also, I very much like the service too, we were served by Jofran, he is very friendly, fun, and attentive, nice to talk too. I would definitely go back here again and try their other food. Definitely a worth the stop experience!","Just had an incredible dinner at Park 27 Korean BBQ and Bar! The modern vibe and top-notch quality of the food blew us away.
🍷The house Cabernet Sauvignon was the perfect pairing, thanks to the friendly staff for the great suggestion!
If you're craving delicious Korean BBQ in a lively atmosphere, this is the place to be!"
Kwan's Deli and Korean Kitchen,4.5,"267 Marietta St NW, Atlanta, GA 30313, USA",(404) 522-9796,"Overall thoughts: wide array of cultural foods with an option for everyone's tastes. Great spicy chicken sauce that I will continue to think about for a while.

Food:
We got the spicy chicken set and the Philly cheese steak with fries.

Whatever the sauce is on the spicy chicken is ✨️MAGICAL✨️. 10 out of 10, if they bottled it and sold it, we would buy some to take home.  We used it on the fries and on the Philly Cheese Steak, and it was fantastic!

The chicken itself was juicy and held a nice layer of the spicy sauce well. The set came with 2 banchan (Korean word for side dishes). These were not your traditional Korean side dishes. However, they are delicious and go well with the meal. They also have a lot of the same flavor notes (sweet, sesame, and vinegar) as what you may see in a more traditional setting.

The Philly Cheese steak is great. The bread was perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the onions and peppers were perfect, and they still had a little crunch to them. The cheese had a great pull (it was provolone), and the fries were crispy.

We also got a side of kimchi. It was crunchy and went great with both meals. We actually bought some to take back to our hotel and have with meals we cook in the room.

Service:
The service was fast, we walked up to the counter and ordered without a wait. Food was out within 10 minutes.

Atmosphere:
There is both inside and outside seating. Centennial park is right outside the restaurant which puts it in a peaceful area. The restaurant is clean but overall the decor feels like a school cafeteria. Also, soft music in the background would help it to feel more cozy.",I was taking a break and found this place near where I parked. Great little deli and I tried the Ruben grilled sandwich and chips. It tasted pretty good. Definitely a nice place to eat when downtown.,"Kwan's Deli and Korean Kitchen is an absolute gem! The fusion of classic deli sandwiches with bold Korean flavors is brilliant. I had the Philly cheesesteak, and it was loaded with tender meat, gooey cheese, and perfectly sautéed mushrooms. The fries were crispy and fresh! Their Korean dishes are just as impressive—bibimbap and bulgogi are must-tries. Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, and great value for the price. Highly recommend!"
Bull Gogi,3.8,"245 Peachtree Center Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA",N/A,"Located in The Hub food court, Bull Gogi offers a decent selection of meats, vegetables, and toppings to build your meal. The quality of the ingredients is satisfactory, and the prices are reasonable for what you get. The staff is friendly and welcoming, which enhances the overall experience.

However, I have some concerns about the cleanliness of the establishment, which could use improvement. While it’s a convenient and tasty option for a quick bite, a little more attention to hygiene would make it even better. Overall, it’s worth a try if you’re in the area and craving Korean-inspired flavors.","So I stopped by here real quick to get some to eat on my lunch break . I ordered fried rice and teriyaki chicken. The fried rice tastes exactly like peanut butter for some reason and the teriyaki chicken tastes burnt . It was only $8.35 ,but I will not be returning to this establishment because why does my food taste like this ?? But presentation wise the food looked good and clean .","Food is fresh, delicious & always consistent. Have been eating here for years & am never disappointed. I love the honey & pepper chicken with fried rice & green beans! Delicious"
East Wave Kitchen,4.3,"60 Luckie St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA",(470) 667-4394,Service was incredible. The Bingsu was so good that my friends and I came back TWICE in the same hour to order more. 1000% a must when visiting Atlanta.,"Neat restaurant
Kindest owner
Soooooo tasty!
Cheap price
Do you need more?","To start, I had no clue this place opened up recently! I originally thought it's been closed for four years, but it reopened under a new owner I think.

This menu is entirely Korean based food, unlike the fusion I've seen in older menus.

I got kimchi + spicy pork + rice and it was delicious for the most part. The price and portion is great for the area. The spicy pork was actually spicy and pretty strong while the kimchi was fermented and strong but savory. My only complaint was that the rice was a little stale.

They provide self-service kiosks and have very hospitable workers. The atmosphere is also very chill but gets full quick during lunch times."
Park Place K-BOB,4.7,"55 Park Pl NE suite#107, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA",(404) 653-0080,"Are you considering Catering Korean Foods? If then, look no further. This place is situated in the heart of downtown Atlanta. Their foods were absolutely scrumptious as well as the owner and other staffs are super friendly and amenable. Top notch services and quality as you can see my photos. Thank you! 😊🙏🏻
We definitely would be ordering again.",The food is really good! really fresh and tasty! I ate the spicy pork cup bob and is 100% recommended.,"If you're ever around the Georgia State University Graduate Admission Office, you've gotta check out Park Place Deli! Their fried vegetable dumplings are absolutely incredible. Crispy on the outside, and filled with flavorful veggies and tofu inside – it's a total game changer. Whether you need a quick snack between classes or just craving some tasty Korean food, this place hits the spot!"
Blossom Tree,4.6,"64 Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA",(404) 223-7500,"We were staying nearby and ordered Blossom Tree for delivery through a 3rd party app. The food arrived hot and delicious!

We tried the Spicy Grilled Chicken Rice and the Crispy Chicken Rice. We enjoyed both, but the crispy chicken was our favorite. The Korean Pickles were our favorite side, and we'd definitely recommend trying these alongside the crispy chicken.","The food here is fantastic! Fairly quick service. Not a whole lot of seating options and the space is pretty tight. When this place gets busy, people are practically standing over you while you eat...but it won't keep me from going back!",Absolute nightmare 😫 I waited well over 15 mins for my food which was Luke warm and NOT fresh! This place used to be sooooo awesome the prices are higher and the quality is horrible I also found a small piece of wire in my food when I call to report the Mgr was def not trained in customer service and told me to walk the 38mins back to the restaurant so she could see (pics included) I'm so glad experienced this before I ordered lunch for my entire department from this place their loss definitely $$$$$ on both my personal business and hundreds on a catering contract 😀 save your $ don't eat here!!!
Umma Kitchen Midtown Atlanta,5.0,"931 Monroe Dr NE A101, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA",(404) 875-0800,"We stopped by today and it was a great experience. It’s a very cute and comfortable atmosphere dining in. The ordering process was simple and quick. The food came out hot and very fast. Ultimately, the food was amazing, very fresh and well seasoned. The owner is very kind and I would highly recommend stopping by if you’re in the area.","Been going here for almost a year now. This place deserves to be known (and it probably already is). Fresh, good quality food (I haven’t been disappointed from anything here), great/simple and clean aesthetics inside, reasonably priced. Cool little Korean snacks/ramen. Terrific customer service. I’m not sure if this is the same management/owners as the previous one that was here, but this current owner is killing it! I hope this one stays here for a while! (Large poke bowl pictured)",We stopped by this adorable restaurant before heading to a comedy show. Everything about the experience was awesome. I ordered the boolgogi bibimbap and it was so delicious! The staff were so friendly and hospitable as well. I highly recommend this place! 5/5 stars.
Letsbap,4.4,"206 Edgewood Ave NE Suite B, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA",(404) 963-2237,"EXCELLENCE - the term “holes in the wall” truly came to life with this place. As a lover of Korea, I was recommended this place for it’s convenient location and elaborate menu. When talking about simplicity and essence, I believe Let’s BAP has it all! I placed a takeout order and ran to the store within 7 minutes and my food was ready - not only that - it was fresh, delicious, and impressively beautiful. I insisted in sharing with my co-worker because I couldn’t enjoy all that goodness alone. The variety within the CupBap arrangements and sides is very nice to me. I promise, I’ve never had Korean food this good in this area of Atlanta. Genuinely feel like I’m eating food from the most talented and adorable “eomma” (엄마 mother in Korean). Surely will keep coming back for comforting tteokbokki, filling japchae, and mouth-watering tofu. Huge check on my list!","I have driven by this place for four years, and finally stopped in today. Blew me away. I got the A1 with an additional bulgogi Kim bap (I was hungry). Everything was outstanding and delicious, and I am half Korean with high standards. The A1 was a little pricey for what you got, but the à la cart Kim bap gave generous portions and was super cheap.","Tasty, affordable, and healthyish, my takeout favorites!

We got delivery from Postmates, and tried a bit of everything. The standouts were the tofu rice pockets (yobuchobap), and the glass noodles (japchae). The Dosirak was a lovely sampler!

We don’t know much about Korean food, so I had to do some googling to figure out what I was ordering (would love to see more photos of the menu items on Postmates and the website!). Was super speedy and packaged very securely - even the sauce containers were Saran-wrapped. Would try again!"
moonbowls (Healthy Korean Bowls- Forrest),4.2,"800 Forrest St NW, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",(866) 692-9615,I had a phenomenal experience with Moonbowls and I will definitely be ordering again! I got the cauliflower bowl and I was so impressed. Next time I'll tell more friends about it too!,"I felt really good about my meal because it was healthy, reasonably priced, and delicious! This will be my go-to place when I’m too lazy to cook. I ordered 2 meals: one for today and one for tomorrow. The bbq chicken bowl was on point! I can’t wait to taste the fried cauliflower bowl tomorrow.",Picked up a delivery from them one time for dinner and the food was just amazing. The midden feel too heavy and felt perfectly spiced and tasty and it was a great dinner that felt light healthy but at the same time tasty and fun to eat. I will definitely be ordering from here more and love their take on approaching healthy and sustainable food
Umbrella Bar,4.5,"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA",(404) 481-6670,"I initially visited Umbrella Bar for their chicken bites, but I became a regular thanks to Ayanna. Her warm hospitality and vibrant personality make every visit enjoyable.","I got the Beef Bulgogi Bibimbap and it was delicious! The meat was tender and flavorful, the egg and rice were cooked perfectly, and the veggies were super fresh! I also got a Thai Iced Tea and it was wonderful! Shout out to Chef Patrick for being very kind and willing to answer any questions! I'll definitely be back. Excited to try more items on the menu!","As someone from a VERY boring food landscape (Montana), getting the second chance in my life to get a Korean corn dog was a necessity on my trip to Atlanta. I’m so happy to have gotten to eat food from this spot instead of literally anywhere else, the atmosphere of the restaurant was super welcoming and the employees were so kind and fast! I could not recommend this spot more. I got the Mozza K-Dog and the Bulgogi Beef Tater Tots and they were INCREDIBLE. The photo does not do it justice, holy moly! I don’t want to go back to Montana when food like this exists 😭"
KPOT Korean BBQ & Hot Pot,4.6,"1715 Howell Mill Rd D-23, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",(404) 343-0819,"This is by far the worst KPOT location I’ve ever been to. I’ve visited multiple KPOTs in Georgia and other states, but this one was a huge disappointment.

First, we were not greeted upon arrival. I informed the hostess that we were a party of two, and without saying a word, she simply escorted us to a table. The real issue, however, was our server. She was incredibly unprofessional and rude, barely speaking to us throughout the entire visit. When I stopped her to place an order, I listed the items we wanted and thanked her, to which she only replied, ""You're welcome."" That was the extent of her interaction with us.

We opted for both the grill and hot pot, but the experience was frustrating. The grill didn’t heat properly, so we waited a long time and tried to adjust the heat ourselves. When the server noticed, she told us we could only max out the heat at the beginning to warm up the grill, and then it needed to stay low. Even after following her instructions, it still took over 20 minutes, and the meat wasn’t cooking properly.

When we tried to order more meat for the hot pot, the server informed us that the manager was monitoring us and we couldn’t order anything else until we finished grilling the food we already had. She claimed this was to prevent food waste, but it felt more like micromanagement and poor service.

To make matters worse, the hot pot broth was overly salty and completely lacked flavor. At checkout, the server stood over me as I selected a tip, which starts at 20%. Considering the service we received, this was incredibly off-putting.

The server even removed meat from the grill that we had placed, telling us not to put too much on at once. The entire experience was uncomfortable and frustrating. I will never return to this location.",While visiting for work we stopped here for dinner. While the food and atmosphere is very good I think Adwin’s service tied it all together for us. Very attentive to our needs and very thorough at explaining the process to us. We appreciate it a lot!!,"It was an amazing experience from the front door to our seats our server, Magic Mike, was amazing and took great care of us. I'm a newbie at this but he made sure we knew all the tips/tricks and best practices. Thanks again Mike! We'll definitely be back!

The food was super fresh. My KPot was extremely flavorful and thanks to Mike I knew the best way to cook everything."
Char Korean Bar & Grill,4.1,"299 North Highland Avenue Northeast, Atlanta, GA 30307, USA",(404) 525-2427,"Stopped by CHAR for drinks, and it did not disappoint! The bartender was awesome—super skilled and friendly. They stay open late, making it the perfect spot to include in your bar-hopping routine. Highly recommend!

Be safe and enjoy!","My husband and I came in for date night. I wanted to like it. The atmosphere and service were fine. However, I ordered a KF Chicken bowl and found a shrimp in it. I don't like shrimp, but I'm not allergic, so it's fine, but left me feeling unsettled, like what other cross contamination is going on. The chicken was left with a lot of ""bits"" on it, making me wonder if they cleaned the chicken properly. Some of the rice was cooked properly, but some of it was hard and some of it was mushy. Everything was overpriced. For the price we were paying, I expected great things and I was extremely disappointed. My husband's order was $27 dollars for a tiny bowl of noodles and three peices of chicken. We ordered the Korean sweet rolls and realized they were just two Hawaiian rolls with garlic and cream cheese. Fine, but not for almost $10. My chicken bowl was $28. For those prices, I could've chosen a much better restaurant and I wish I had.","Holy delicious!! Char was my first experience with Korean bbq and it was INCREDIBLE. All of our food, from the appetizers to the meal down to the salads and drinks were so delicious, it is unlike anything I’ve had but so comforting at the same time! Char has a very chill atmosphere, it is decorated in a pleasing but not overwhelming way, and the employees were absolutely lovely! Food and drinks came out fast and our server gave us some amazing recommendations from the menu and overall made the experience go above and beyond. If I didn’t live across the country, I would be coming here every week, it’s so worth it!!!"
Krave,4.7,"1170 Collier Rd NW Suite B&C, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",(404) 228-0840,I've eaten here 3 times in the last month and a half...food was on point every time. Here are pics of the first 2 times. The 3rd time was the rib platter w/chicken bulgogi platter. Good neighborhood spot...I dined in one time and ordered to go twice!,"I’ve had this place on my radar for a while and I’m so glad I decided to stop for lunch! Had the spicy bulgogi chicken bowl and hot honey fries.  Both options are great but the chicken was the highlight for me! Perfectly juicy and very well seasoned. The spice level is just right- mildly hot and slightly sweet with a bunch of additional flavors. Prices aren’t too bad either! I’ll definitely be back with my family at some point, hopefully in the near future!",Sign stated opened till 3. Arrived at 2:40 and was told politely that they were closed. I stated it was 2:40 and she said sorry the kitchen is closed.  Just wanted to order some food to go. Should have posted closed at 2:30 and locked the doors if they didn't want to serve customers until 3.
ONE Korean Bistro (Inside Lee & White Food Hall),4.0,"1020 White St SW Stall #10, Atlanta, GA 30310, USA",(404) 748-4203,"We ordered dinner through door dash while in town for the weekend.
Beef bulgogi ramyun, beef bulgogi kimbap, pork kimbap and chicken dumplings.
Everything is flavorful, warm and delicious.  Can't wait to eat here again.","I love food halls that aren’t too crowded, and this one is just my pace. ONE Korean Bistro’s fried shrimp hand roll with yum yum and spicy dipping sauce is my fav. It’s fun to order a couple of things from different places and take it outside on a beautiful day!","onekoreanbistro at @leeandwhite is a crowd favorite! This spot offers Korean fusion cuisine that’s sweet and savory, perfectly tailored to international tastes.

Seeing so many people enjoying the food here makes me proud as a Korean.

They also serve drinks, and their Jeju Tangerine Highball is generously made with premium ingredients.

While everyone knows Krog Street Market and Ponce City Market in Atlanta, it seems Lee+White is still under the radar for some. Located on the BeltLine, it‘s an emerging market with a fantastic food hall. Be sure to check it out!

What I ordered:
1) Potato Corn Dog
2) Bulgogi Box
3) Spicy Pork Kimbap
4) Twisted Potato
5) So-Maek Beer
6) Jeju Tangerine Highball"
Bene Korean BBQ,4.8,"555 Main St NE, Atlanta, GA 30324, USA",(770) 800-7323,"I'm so excited that we stumbled across this new Korean BBQ. Hands down the best you'll find closest to midtown! The restaurant is a total vibe - squeaky clean, and beautifully styled. Service was stellar. Food was everything not only did it taste fresh and delicious, but every plate was also presented with care in other words - they weren't just thrown on a plate and served. You can tell whoever is in the kitchen is taking their time to roll out dishes with thoughtfulness and care. I highly recommend it and look forward to our next visit!","Only had a chance to get takeout today, but the food is great! Honestly, I wasn’t expecting too much since they are in Buckhead, but their food is authentic and tastes delicious . I ordered the galbi box, beef & seafood tofu soup, bulgogi bibimbap, and beef short rib stew, all were amazing. Their banchan is 10/10. I was kind of thrown off by the pink/purple salad dressing but it’s addicting 🤤 The gentleman in the front was kind and even helped me bring my order to my car, which i thought was very sweet. I will definitely return to Bene KBBQ for a team dinner!",Really modern atmosphere for a Korean bbq restaurant and I really enjoyed it! We had the beef set for 2 and everything tasted fresh. It was also a lot less Smokey compare to other kbbq restaurants. It's on the pricier side but I definitely recommend if you want to enjoy a night out!
Hankook Taqueria,4.7,"1341 Collier Rd NW, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",(404) 352-8881,"Nothing like an unassuming gem. This place has a great vibe and is relatively cheap for unique, solid fusion food. The calamari taco was delicious.

The parking is a little tight when it’s busy.","My wife and I visited excited to try some interesting fusion food. Neither of us disliked the food, but it just didn't taste Korean at all. The bulgogi tasted nothing like bulgogi and the daegogi didn't taste like any Korean pork I'd ever had. The dumplings were alright, and the kelp/seaweed flavor in the ketchup was interesting. If you pretend it's not supposed to be Korean fusion it's a pretty good taco joint but it's really disappointing when that's the expectation.","Hankook Taqueria is tucked away on a small road in NW Atlanta, but don’t let the unassuming location fool you—the food is incredible. We started with the kokuma as an appetizer, alongside chips and queso, and ordered two bulgogi burrito combos for our main course.

The kokuma (sweet potato) was a delightful surprise. It was tender, and the sauce paired with it perfectly, enhancing the soft texture. The chips and queso were standard, but we found ourselves dipping the kokuma in the queso as well, which turned out to be a delicious combination.

As for the burritos, they were fantastic! The beef bulgogi was savory, with rich flavors of sesame and chili oil blending beautifully. The burrito portions are generous, enough to satisfy any appetite.

The staff was knowledgeable and offered helpful recommendations on flavor pairings. They offer a wide variety of protein options, including beef, chicken, seafood, and vegetarian choices, so there’s something for everyone.

Fun fact: Guy Fieri featured Hankook Taqueria on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives for its flavorful fusion of Korean and Mexican street food. Their menu, while not too large, offers a great selection of flavors. Hankook Taqueria truly gives off that cozy “hole-in-the-wall” vibe while serving up an unforgettable dining experience."
Gaja Korean Bar,4.4,"491 Flat Shoals Ave SE A, Atlanta, GA 30316, USA",(404) 835-2126,Great atmosphere although it’s a bit loud. Food was amazing but some shareable plates are too little for the price. 5 small pieces of dumplings of $9 and we have to order separate banchan for $5. Service was fast.,"Cool spot for trendy east-siders. Sat at the bar and the bartender that waited on us was extremely impatient and borderline rude as we had a couple questions about the menu. What was worse is that she was very nice to the couple next to us with whom she knew and I think were regulars (they were also younger and more hip). It also seemed like she was an owner or manager by the way she was speaking to the other couple. IF she is a manager or owner, she really needs to reevaluate what she is doing with her life because she seems extremely unhappy to be in customer service.
Food was just okay. I had a tofu dish and it was good but not something I’m going back for. Scallion cakes were flavorless. Mushroom lettuce wraps had great flavor but some of the mushrooms were too chewy to eat. Drinks were also just meh. Cool spot, great atmosphere, but needs to improve service and food.","I went to Gaja to grab some Korean fried chicken to carry out. I was not greeted when I entered. Waited at the bar for a while to be acknowledged. Finally, I got to order. Food came out very quickly However, it took forever to get my check.  The way the food is packaged causes the chicken sweat; so it’s not going to be crispy. Although the flavor of the food was good, it was not like Korean chicken more like a sweet buffalo chicken with blue cheese. I would not return to get Korean chicken."

You get a very generous size portion for 15$. Everything is premade and no wait time. You can fill the bowl with lots of veggies and they offer either chicken or beef as base protein. We recommend the chicken and it’s bit spicy. Ramen comes with three dumplings and it was delicious too. Owner is very kind and I recommend this place if you are up for a quick healthy meal.","I visited for the first time, and I was impressed! The ingredients were fresh, and the owner was incredibly kind and welcoming. He was generous with the portion and even added a warm, sweet message to my to-go order. I will return to try some of the other options!",Second time coming here and it is so good each time! First time I got udon with dumplings. This time and what’s pictured is a bulgogi bowl. Both are amazing! The ingredients are fresh and delicious. I love being able to add so much to my bowl. Highly recommend!!!
bb.q Chicken Decatur,4.4,"319 W Ponce de Leon Ave #40, Decatur, GA 30030, USA",(404) 941-7126,"I recently had a meal at BBQ Chicken in Decatur, and I was really impressed. The food was served hot, fresh, and full of flavor! The chicken was tender with a perfect balance of sweet and savory, and the seasoning was on point. The veggies were fresh and added a great balance to the dish. If you’re looking for a satisfying meal with bold flavors, this place is definitely worth checking out. Highly recommend!","Listen, if you want CRUNCHY Korean Fried Chicken, this is the place! My wife brought me here for date night and l absolutely loved it! The food was full of flavor, fresh and came out in a decent time. The staff was friendly, the environment was a vibe, and our plates didn't cost an arm and a leg. This is the only place we'll be going for Authentic Korean Fried Chicken.","My friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant, decided to eat here, and enjoyed ourselves! We tried the half chicken Golden original, Corn salad(deliciously made by Alex), Gold peak sweet tea, Ddeok-bokki, and Gangnam style chicken with pickled radish! Yummy!!!! 😋 Great atmosphere and service too!"
Iron Age Korean Steakhouse - Druid Hills,4.5,"2947 N Druid Hills Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA",(404) 254-0568,LOVE THIS PLACE. It’s so good for the value it has. For the price it’s amazing all you can eat food. I had multiple plates of the bulgogi and I come back for it every time. Kbbq isn’t always the best around ATL but I love this place and I’m always happy to eat here for a big meal with friends or a celebration. I often come here on my birthday. Lots of meat selection and the YUM YUM SAUCE IS SO FREAKING GOOD I had multiple refills of the sauce. Highly recommend. Lunch has a cheaper price when not on weekends too!! Good value,"Came here with a buddy of mine on 12/9/24
The experience was decent… not my favorite place for Korean bbq but it was good. Meat quality is good and reasonably for the prices. $32 per person and $16 for a child the menu states and that’s for dinner prices. They also provide flavor soju for $12 which is alright. Don’t miss out on the experience. We arrived here around 3:00pm and it was not busy at all we were the only table around that time.

I recommend getting the rice cakes, pork belly, bulgogi and seasoned steak it pairs well with a Cass beer.","One of my favorite ayce kbbq places I’ve ever been to.

Bulgogi was crazy; Iron Age steak, pork bulgogi, brisket, and pork belly were all great as well

Only 2 meats per round but good portions and they change the grill for each round and have different grills for the kind of meats you order

Not a lot of banchan but they have extra sides that you can order. Japchae and tteokbokki were both good, esp the tteokbokki

They also have 4 different sauces

Service was great

Love that they play kpop music videos on the walls. Good vibes

Great value for the price ($29)

Good parking

They also have a cute pink jinro frog for pics at the front c:"
Salaryman Toco Hills,4.5,"2941 N Druid Hills Rd ste b, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA",(404) 990-4275,"American Japanese Korean fusion, but I am
missing some key Korean/Japanese keystones!

Great import beer and sake selection. If you like sake they have so many types! But no Umeshu.

I got bibimbap because I needed veggies. Tonkatsu ramen was pretty good (but not as good as a pure ramen place.)

Want to go back and try their Korean friend chicken pizza really bad, looked amazing with fresh Korean pickles on top.

But no japchae on the whole menu so that was disappointing.

Waiter was chill and place has good vibes. Might be a new favorite spot because the combo of food selections and drinks.","SALARY-MANNNN. I love yalll 🥲 The wraps were amazing and I also ate the wagyu beef kimchi lasagna?!?!?! CRACK. And when you come, ask for Jay!!! She had the drinks flowing and wrapped up the entire experience. Thank me after you try the TKO ❤️","2024 update:  Finally got the chance to come back… for dinner this time. Food once again is a great combination of flavors, and portions were larger than the Bento lunch package. We had a burger, two types of KFC buns, (KKC and pork)  and the chicken were all excellent. Only issue was they were out a Sapporo(sp) draft beer, but they gave us a sample of an alternative that was nice. A glass of Chardonnay was more than any of their mixed drinks and the portion was pretty average for the $15 charged.

2023 review: Unusual name for a restaurant and a great place for a change of pace. It costs a little more than fast food, but worth it to try another culinary experience. We went there for lunch and both had  Bento. (a lunch package with a protein, salad, gyoza (wonton) and rice). Nice bar, interior and outdoor seating. Trivia on Tuesday nights. Service was friendly and efficient."
9292 Korean BBQ,4.5,"225 E Trinity Pl, Decatur, GA 30030, USA",(678) 973-2454,"First time dining and the atmosphere and service was amazing. Our server Alexis was so friendly, courteous and professional during our visit. The bulgogi, lemon pepper chicken and the marinated pork steak were phenomenal along with the Ramen bowl. You won’t be disappointed with great food and phenomenal service by Alexis.","I enjoyed the Korean barbeque here with a large group of 16 people. They were able to handle us on a Saturday night without issue or waiting.

Our service was incredibly attentive, always their to bring us our next two selections.

The food was delicious. My top choices were the bulgogi, ribeye, and spicy chicken.","The service started out a bit flat, but then improved greatly once our BBQ was underway.

The food was really delicious, and it was my first time at a Korean BBQ restaurant, and it's definitely a fun experience to have meat prepared at a personal BBQ at your table. Also the cheesy corn that comes with the BBQ is so delicious.

The meal also starts out with a ton of small plates of spicy or pickled items to snack on, which are served at no added cost. You can also eat them alongside your meal later.

My friend and I shared a bottle of white grape Soju (a Korean alcoholic drink) that perfectly complimented the BBQ. All in all we had a great time."
KPOT Korean BBQ & Hot Pot,4.7,"2955 Cobb Pkwy SE Suite 830, Atlanta, GA 30339, USA",(678) 335-5388,"Visited this place with a friend and had a lovely time. The food was great. Bria was our waitress and she was very attentive and friendly. She also helped us order and explained everything kindly. The rest of the staff were also nice. The food arrive very quickly. The food bad had plenty of options including dessert. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience.","I recently visited KPot and unfortunately had a pretty disappointing experience. The hostesses were very inattentive. When we arrived after being told our table was ready, they just walked right past us multiple times without acknowledging us, but allowed other customers to interrupt them talking to us. The server was okay, but she turned the stove up way too high, causing most of our food to burn before it could cook properly. She did notice later on and adjusted the heat, but by that point, a lot of the food was already ruined.

The steak was terrible, but the bulgogi and salmon were definitely the highlights of the meal. The ambiance was nice, but unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired. To make matters worse, the booths and tables weren’t installed into the ground, so they moved easily. At one point, another customer literally got up and moved our entire booth just to get closer to their table, which was really uncomfortable.

Overall, while the food had a few good moments, the poor service and awkward seating situation made it hard to enjoy the meal. Customer service needs a serious overhaul. I was pretty disappointed.","I had a delightful time at KPOT! This was my first time visiting and the food was incredibly flavorful, and the cleanliness of the place was impressive. The service was top-notch, and the ambiance added to the overall dining experience. Our server was Kay, she was super attentive and made sure we had the best experience. I can't wait to go back for more delicious HOTPOT!"
SSAMJANG Korean BBQ,4.8,"2860 Cumberland Mall Ste 1109, Atlanta, GA 30339, USA",(678) 730-1370,"This place is slept on! This is the BEST Korean bbq my husband and I have EVER eaten! The portions are plenty and quality meats, the sauces are delicious, and the sides are exquisite! Fairly priced and food is filling! We love it!",대박 Hands-down the most authentic Korean food I’ve eaten my last memorable experience at Toronto! All dishes were so flavorful and a sight to behold. Will certainly be making this place my go-to haven for Korean soul food. Must visit for all who love Korean food or are looking to give it a try!,"Ssamjang is fantastic! Nestled behind Cumberland mall, it is the most upscale Korean bbq experience you’ll find in Atlanta. I love how they incorporate vegetables and fruits when your meats arrive. Grill the pineapple!!!! The drink selection was very nice, complimentary to the variety of food. I love the deserts you can get at the end! You can take food to go as well!"
Iron Age Korean Steakhouse - Sandy Springs,4.4,"5600 Roswell Rd Suite F290, Sandy Springs, GA 30342, USA",(678) 974-5075,"Thought this was a great intro to KBBQ- never been before! We went for a friend's birthday party, and even though we had a rezzi, it still took about 20 mins to get seated even though the restaurant didn't look that busy.
The lemon chicken was really good, the beef bulgogi was delicious, as was the beef brisket and iron age steak (though our 2nd order of the iron age was soooooo fatty, half of us had to spit some pieces out cuz we couldn't get through it!), disappointed in all the pork we had- just not that good. The sides were fine, but really liked the rice and the little oblong things with red pepper flakes- not sure the name but they were soooo good and not spicy!
Overall, we had a fantastic time, though our server seemed kind of slow getting anything out but the meats. We would like to return again sometime.",Nice big restaurant. This branch is always busy and you have to wait to be seated. Good selection of delicious meat and side dish are all very good too. The server is very nice and helpful with our grilling.,"Food is amazing, so so good. Service can be lacking sometimes though… it affects your experience. But the food, so good! Hawaiian Bulgogi, Seasoned steak and spicy chicken! Faves"
