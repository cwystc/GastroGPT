    # This is a placeholder.  You'll need to define how to score/rank restaurants
    # based on the `user_preferences`.  For example:
    # 1.  Parse the restaurant reviews for mentions of preferred cuisines.
    # 2.  Check if the price range is within the user's preference.
    # 3.  Boost the score based on the rating.

    # Right now, just return the original results.
