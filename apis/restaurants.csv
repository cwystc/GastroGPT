Moge tee & Korean Style Chicken,4.4,"848 Spring St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA",(404) 963-7986,"I had drumsticks today, but the smell was soooooo bad... 🤢I’ve never had such a strong, unpleasant chicken odor before. This really needs to be addressed. But tender is good.",Ridiculously delicious!! Was worried about the price but then saw the portions and was blown away. So good and the service was wonderful! Boba was soooo tasty as well. I recommend for eaters who love leftovers!!!,"I noticed the grand opening sign, and decided to check this place out. I ordered the garlic soy wings, I believe that’s what the flavor was called, and omggg! It was delicious. The food came out quickly, and the service was okay. Nothing spectacular. However, I will definitely be back for the wings alone."
Park 27 Korean BBQ and Bar - Midtown,4.3,"950 W Peachtree St NW Suite 255, Atlanta, GA 30309, USA",(770) 727-7275,"Absolutely fantastic experience! The food was incredible—fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked right at the table. But what truly set this place apart was the outstanding service. The staff was not only friendly and attentive but also incredibly knowledgeable, making the meal even more enjoyable. Ask to be helped by Jofran! He is the man!

The atmosphere is vibrant and full of energy, making it a perfect spot for a fun night out.

If you have never had Korean BBQ get your butt in here and try!","Ummmm, yeah. Loved the food at Park 27! I wish I had someone with me to get the all you can eat. Huge selection with that option and much cheaper. Overall the process was very well placed for the quality and level of service.",We had a large party with reservations.  The meal was fantastic. It was my first time having Korean food and it was delicious. Every single thing I ate was great.
CM Korean Fried Chicken & Ssong’s Hot Dog,4.2,"525 10th St NW, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",(404) 881-8856,I live nearby and decided to make a stop in and was so glad I did!! The food was DELICIOUS! 😋 I had the Honey Garlic Chicken and it was very flavorful and cooked just right. I will definitely be back soon to try some other items. Miss Priscilla was very helpful in helping me choose something delicious and was so friendly!! 😀 Great service!!,All the food we ordered was delicious. We were traveling and stopped because they had great reviews. We will definitely come back anytime we drive through. The staff was all lap helpful and nice.,"Stopped here because Rocky Mountain Pizza’s kitchen canceled my door dash, and after I took a Lyft thier kitchen had JuST closed. I am not disappointed as their automated ordering and fast service ended up producing delicious and hot food. Some of the locals mentioned it’s open until 2am for all your early morning munch needs!"
Pelicana Chicken Atlanta,4.9,"420 14th St NW #100A, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",(404) 856-3960,Been riding past this place for a long time. Finally decided to stop in on a Saturday night. Wasn’t crowded at all. Not much parking in the front but there is a parking lot right in the back with plenty of free parking. The Atmosphere was amazing the lighting the cleanliness and just overall customer service was top tier! Let’s not forget about the food because that was the icing on the cake! Food was hot and fresh tasted amazing. I’ll definitely be back☺️,"So we just stumbled upon this restaurant as we were walking past it. Saw the great reviews so decided to try it. There is a big halal sign outside and very also verified with the owner that their chicken is halal. That was the main reason for us to eat here.

Service is great and welcoming. Served small cups of Korean coffee on the house.

We ordered the full chicken, spicy and crispy with side of garlic sauce.

It was good but my observations were 1) full chicken is cut up into 14 small pieces but some pieces just have a lot of crispy batter but no real meat, just bones. Even the pieces that have meat, have a lot of extra batter but not much meat 2) the 3 sides are very small for a full chicken platter

Overall, it was good but not great. Didn't feel like we got a full chicken.","Firstly, The food was Delicious! I got the shrimp fried rice & whole chicken lightly fried spicy W/ level 3 sauce on the side. The sauce itself wasn’t as spicy in my opinion it was more tasty & flavorful. The sides that came with the meal was a delicate potion for a large entree. The choice of house dressing for the side salad is amazing.
The ambiance is a relaxing yet upbeat/upscale vibration; perfect for date night or meeting up with friends.
In addition to the mouth watering food; the Customer Service & Staff were very friendly & attentive.
My server was “Dano” & he is a Rockstar at serving. He was super informative, explained the menu in detail, & even when busy a smile remained on his face.
“Amy” came over after my meal was complete & ensured I had a great experience. The entire staff, all displayed Top Level workmanship and teamwork to run a successful restaurant business. Thank you for making my First Time there memorable.

Mukja Korean Fried Chicken,4.5,"933 Peachtree St NE Suite 951, Atlanta, GA 30309, USA",(404) 855-5516,"I thought i left a review. Anyway, I came during AWA and this was my first time. I had a gift for the owner but he didn't work that day maybe next time😅. Food wise everything was great definitely has a bit of spice but it was flavorful and you could see and taste the love they put into this. Also, there was a parking deck right next to the store with varying times. My order took about 10-20 mins(large order) and i didn't even have to pay. 100% check this place out",The kimchi fries were amazing. I think I got a close favorite next to poutine. We ordered mukja and tofu bowls. Serving size and spices were great!,"Absolutely delicious!! I usually don’t eat downtown as the parking situation can be tricky, but there is a garage attached to the building and they validate parking. Chicken was crispy and delicious, fries were 10/10. I’m not ITP ATL very often but this will be my first stop next time I’m around."
Park27 Korean BBQ and Bar - Centennial Park,4.7,"275 Baker St NW Suite B, Atlanta, GA 30313, USA",(404) 390-3009,"If you are looking for a different dining experience, this is the place for you. You get to socialize and cook the food and then enjoy the great food. The staff here go above and beyond, will give recommendations and assist you with grilling the meats. Very accommodating. We did the all you can eat dinner option and was not disappointed. Ate more than we probably should have and everything was amazing. Definitely worth the price. Meal comes with lots of banchan (side dishes located around the grill) and four difference sauces to dip your meats into. Highly recommend.","Just had an incredible dinner at Park 27 Korean BBQ and Bar! The modern vibe and top-notch quality of the food blew us away.
🍷The house Cabernet Sauvignon was the perfect pairing, thanks to the friendly staff for the great suggestion!
If you're craving delicious Korean BBQ in a lively atmosphere, this is the place to be!","This was a truly amazing dinner with plenty of meats selection ( we ordered all you can eat for 2 ) and several custom sides (as each place makes them little differently). The most surprising but also most delicious was the charcoal grill, which added an unforgettable flavor to the already great marinated meats. We are tourists so unfortunately won’t have many chances to come back often, but when we do - this is our place to go. Big  Thank you to our server as well. It was a great night!"
Kwan's Deli and Korean Kitchen,4.5,"267 Marietta St NW, Atlanta, GA 30313, USA",(404) 522-9796,"Overall thoughts: wide array of cultural foods with an option for everyone's tastes. Great spicy chicken sauce that I will continue to think about for a while.

Food:
We got the spicy chicken set and the Philly cheese steak with fries.

Whatever the sauce is on the spicy chicken is ✨️MAGICAL✨️. 10 out of 10, if they bottled it and sold it, we would buy some to take home.  We used it on the fries and on the Philly Cheese Steak, and it was fantastic!

The chicken itself was juicy and held a nice layer of the spicy sauce well. The set came with 2 banchan (Korean word for side dishes). These were not your traditional Korean side dishes. However, they are delicious and go well with the meal. They also have a lot of the same flavor notes (sweet, sesame, and vinegar) as what you may see in a more traditional setting.

The Philly Cheese steak is great. The bread was perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the onions and peppers were perfect, and they still had a little crunch to them. The cheese had a great pull (it was provolone), and the fries were crispy.

We also got a side of kimchi. It was crunchy and went great with both meals. We actually bought some to take back to our hotel and have with meals we cook in the room.

Service:
The service was fast, we walked up to the counter and ordered without a wait. Food was out within 10 minutes.

Atmosphere:
There is both inside and outside seating. Centennial park is right outside the restaurant which puts it in a peaceful area. The restaurant is clean but overall the decor feels like a school cafeteria. Also, soft music in the background would help it to feel more cozy.",I was taking a break and found this place near where I parked. Great little deli and I tried the Ruben grilled sandwich and chips. It tasted pretty good. Definitely a nice place to eat when downtown.,"The dumplings are absolutely outstanding! All of the food is wonderful and very nicely presented. Good good Korean spot to stop and eat.

The bulgogi and Bimibop is wonderful as well with both light and saucy sides. I will be back to Kwan’s!"
Bull Gogi,3.8,"245 Peachtree Center Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA",N/A,"Located in The Hub food court, Bull Gogi offers a decent selection of meats, vegetables, and toppings to build your meal. The quality of the ingredients is satisfactory, and the prices are reasonable for what you get. The staff is friendly and welcoming, which enhances the overall experience.

However, I have some concerns about the cleanliness of the establishment, which could use improvement. While it’s a convenient and tasty option for a quick bite, a little more attention to hygiene would make it even better. Overall, it’s worth a try if you’re in the area and craving Korean-inspired flavors.","So I stopped by here real quick to get some to eat on my lunch break . I ordered fried rice and teriyaki chicken. The fried rice tastes exactly like peanut butter for some reason and the teriyaki chicken tastes burnt . It was only $8.35 ,but I will not be returning to this establishment because why does my food taste like this ?? But presentation wise the food looked good and clean .","It’s your stereotypical mall Chinese place, but they also have some Korean and Japanese options as well. Definitely the cheapest place to go to in the food court. Sort of weirded out on the fact that you need to purchase 3 sides to get 2 meats, but no big deal. Green beans and plantains were good. Loved the teriyaki chicken. Sesame chicken is also pretty good. Only 10 bucks for a 2 meat plate, and the portion sizes are decent, so it’s worth the money."
Park Place K-BOB,4.7,"55 Park Pl NE suite#107, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA",N/A,"Are you considering Catering Korean Foods? If then, look no further. This place is situated in the heart of downtown Atlanta. Their foods were absolutely scrumptious as well as the owner and other staffs are super friendly and amenable. Top notch services and quality as you can see my photos. Thank you! 😊🙏🏻
We definitely would be ordering again.","Decided to stop by here while in the area for a work conference. This little hole in the wall place is run by a loving family and reminds me of home. Really adored the friendliness of the staff who offered recommendations. Came back to do take out the next day because I found out they were closed weekends!

The food is well made and super tasty--it gives me the vibe of home made comfort food. I'd highly recommend coming here if you are in the area!!","If you're ever around the Georgia State University Graduate Admission Office, you've gotta check out Park Place Deli! Their fried vegetable dumplings are absolutely incredible. Crispy on the outside, and filled with flavorful veggies and tofu inside – it's a total game changer. Whether you need a quick snack between classes or just craving some tasty Korean food, this place hits the spot!"
Blossom Tree,4.6,"64 Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA",(404) 223-7500,"We were staying nearby and ordered Blossom Tree for delivery through a 3rd party app. The food arrived hot and delicious!

We tried the Spicy Grilled Chicken Rice and the Crispy Chicken Rice. We enjoyed both, but the crispy chicken was our favorite. The Korean Pickles were our favorite side, and we'd definitely recommend trying these alongside the crispy chicken.",Absolute nightmare 😫 I waited well over 15 mins for my food which was Luke warm and NOT fresh! This place used to be sooooo awesome the prices are higher and the quality is horrible I also found a small piece of wire in my food when I call to report the Mgr was def not trained in customer service and told me to walk the 38mins back to the restaurant so she could see (pics included) I'm so glad experienced this before I ordered lunch for my entire department from this place their loss definitely $$$$$ on both my personal business and hundreds on a catering contract 😀 save your $ don't eat here!!!,"You do the ordering yourself on a kiosk which was fine for us. The lady that was there was very nice and answered my questions about ingredients.

Food was DELICIOUS! Had to wait a few minutes but totally worth it.  Pork bullgogi was very spicy to the point I couldn't finish my taco.

Only issue to no fault of the business was the amount of homeless people hanging around as well as road closures. If you want close parking parked at 90 Forsyth Street Northwest. It was a 3 minute walk."
